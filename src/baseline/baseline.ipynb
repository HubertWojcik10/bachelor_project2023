      "<s> Pomidor QuixoteDaily StormerJanuary 1, 2020People should look at this as a kind of homework for the schools’ sexual education curricula.Breitbart:The scourge of sexual exploitation of children has reached “epidemic” levels in the United Kingdom, as nearly 19,000 children were sexually groomed over the past year. Local authorities have reported over 18,700 suspected victims of child sexual exploitation at the hands of grooming gangs between 2018-19, more than five times higher than the 3,300 reported cases just five years ago. Sammy Woodhouse, a victim of the Rotherham rapist Arshid Hussain, said that the authorities have not implemented meaningful changes in combatting the crisis.It’s almost as if the authorities wanted this to happen.“You hear this bullshit line, ‘lessons have been learned’, but they haven’t learned anythings and stuff.The Economy would suffer and it would be a total disaster.Silent Guardian of The EconomyThere’s just no other way.If we want The Economy to prosper, we have to allow these hard-working men to groom our daughters.</s>\n",
